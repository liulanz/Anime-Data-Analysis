## Project Description
Write out a paragraph describing your project idea. Define the input and output of your model and what your model will be predicting, or if it is a visualization project, what visualizations you will include.

This will be a Data Visualization project. The main idea of it is given certain criteria (the input) by the user, the application recommends them an anime they might like. The output of it will be a list of anime in descending order of ratings, information about the anime, and a link to the site to read more about the anime in the form of [https://myanimelist.net/anime/<ID>/].

Data Visualization:
-   Main idea: Given a form for the user to input, recommend them an anime they might like.
  
Possible feature:
-   Show the popularity of the anime released in a given year or time based on the average number of users who liked it.
-   Show the number of anime per genre in a given time and what are those anime.
-   given a cluster of anime and itâ€™s information, predict how well an upcoming anime will do based on the average number of users like on the upcoming anime and its genre.
